		<h1>Adrian Naranjo</h1>	
		<h2>The Gist of Me</h2>
		<p>I'm a Software Engineer and like building stuff.<br>
			<br>	
			Studied philosophy as an undergrad. Best decision ever.<br>
			<br>
			Employers didn't agree about the usefulness of philosophy, so I studied some finance and started working at a hospital building models of patient trends to support rate negotiations against insurance companies. Here I learned SQL, a little about databases, and a lot about data wrangling and cleaning.<br>
			<br>
			Then I moved through several analytic consulting posiitons until finally I was hired to build and manage the logic and data layers of product sold by a boutique consulting firm. By now I had become a database expert, deployed ETL processes, ran UNIX on my home machine, and scraped websites using Java and Python. So, why not go back to school?<br>
