		<h1>Hi. I'm Adrian.</h1>
			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I'm a Software Engineer who studied philosophy as an undergrad, traveled the US for a several years
					as an analytics consultant, and now study computer science (with a focus on machine learning) at <a href =
					"http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a>. I have a lot of experience with data,
					and especially a lot of experience with bad data (consultants aren't hired when the situation is easy
					or even manageable).</p>

				<p>But, my skills extend beyond processing, automating, and using data. I've worked with healthcare executives
				from 3 different countries, provided consulting services to high ranking politicans of a foreign country,
				built and automated analytic tools so that others can perform detailed analyses with only a few clicks of a
				button, and developed and managed others.</p>
