		<h1>Hi. I'm Adrian.</h1>
			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I studied philosophy as an undergrad, worked for a few years doing analytics
					consulting, and now study computer science at <a href = "http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/">
					Northwestern University</a>. Technical speaking, I'm great with data. Having worked in an industry where clients
					generally have outdated processes and terrible data (hence, why they hire consultants) has made me adaptable
					and given me a diverse set of skills.</p>

		<h3>Predicting Loan Defaults on Prosper</h3>
			<p>Without any predictors except Amount Borrowed, Borrower Rating, Length of the Loan, and
				Interest Rate, was able to predict whether a given loan would default with 75% accuracy. This is significantly
				better than random, but not as good as was hoped for (90%+).</p>

			<p>The results can be found <a href = "Loan_Analysis/Final_Report.html">here</a>.</p>

			<p>An exploratory data analysis of the data can be found <a href = "Loan_Analysis/EDA.html">here</a>
				.</p>

			<p>The code can be found <a href = "https://github.com/a-orangetree/LoanAnalysis">here</a>.</p>

			<h3>Predicting Crime in Austin, TX</h3>
				<p> Predicted crime in Austin, TX for the year 2016 by zip code. An rmse of 375 was achieved using
					Lasso. Should historical crime data be added from the years 2014 and 2015 the rmse drops to 154.</p>

				<p>A website for this project can be found <a href = "https://prachu95.github.io/">here</a>.</p>

				<p>The code can be found <a href = "https://github.com/a-orangetree/City_Of_Austin">here</a>.</p>

			<h3>Deducing the Origin of Facebook Confessions Board Posts Using Only Sentiment</h3>
				<p>Built a classifier to categorize the country of origin of posts on Facebook Confessions Board using only
					sentiment. Random forest and boosted trees resulted in a model accuracy of +90%.</p>

				<p>The results can be found in this
					<a href = "https://github.com/a-orangetree/Facebook_Confessions/blob/master/SocialMedia_FinalPaper.pdf">paper
					</a>.<p>

				<p>An exploratory data analysis can be found <a href = "Facebook_Confessions_Forum/EDA.html">here</a>.</p>

				<p>The code can be found <a href = "https://github.com/a-orangetree/Facebook_Confessions">here</a>.</p>

			<h3>College Football Scraper & Analysis</h3>
				<p>Used Python to retrieve college football team, player, and game statistics from the web, store data in a
					SQLite database, and perform analyses using Pythonâ€™s NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries. Since
					this no longer being maintained, it is now a tutorial on the pandas library.</p>

				<p>The tutorial can be found
					<a href = "https://github.com/a-orangetree/College_Football_Scrape/blob/master/SampleAnalysisUsingPython%26JupyterNotebook.ipynb">
						here</a>.</p>
