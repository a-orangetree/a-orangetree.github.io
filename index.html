		<h1>Adrian Naranjo</h1>	
		<h2>Software Engineer</h2>
		<p>
				I studied philosophy as an undergrad (best decision ever). Unfortunately, employers didn't agree about its usefulness, so I studied some finance and started working at a hospital. There I built models of patient trends using Excel and SQL while learning a bit about databases and a lot about data wrangling.<br>
			<br>
			Since then I've been employed as an analytics consultant until finally hired to build and manage the logic and data layers of product sold by a boutique consulting firm. By now I had become a database expert, deployed ETL processes, ran UNIX on my home machine, and scraped websites using Java and Python. Then it hit me: I'm head over heals for computers. So, why not go back to school and have a blast studying Computer Science at a steller university? So, that's what I'm doing.<br>

		<h2>Projects Not Listed on GitHub</h2>
			<p>
				I've written several programs, from scratch, which I don't own. The below is a description of those projects.
			</p>

		<h3>837 Parser</h3>
			<p>
				837 files contain patient claim transaction data from a healthcare organization. Few alternatives exist to parse the complicated formating of these files. Using Python and Regular Expressions 837 files are parsed and a simple, easy to read output is produced.
			</p>
		
		<h3>Charge Capture Assessment Tool</h3>
			<p>
				Saved consultants days to weeks by creating a tool to automate repetitive tasks. Tool tested data integrity, performed descriptive statistical analysis, and modeled potential future states.
