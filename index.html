		<h1>Adrian Naranjo</h1>	
		<p>I'm a Software Engineer and like building stuff.<br>
			<br>	
			Studied philosophy as an undergrad. Best decision ever. However, employers didn't agree about its usefulnes, so I studied some finance and started working at a hospital. There I built models of patient trends to support rate negotiations against insurance companies and learned SQL, a little about databases, and a lot about data wrangling and cleaning.<br>
			<br>
			Since then I've been employed as an analytics consultant until finally hired to build and manage the logic and data layers of product sold by a boutique consulting firm. By now I had become a database expert, deployed ETL processes, ran UNIX on my home machine, and scraped websites using Java and Python. Then it hit me: I'm head over heals for computers. So, why not go back to school, get an advanced degree from a stellar university, and have a blast learning the newest developments (Artificial Intelligence, anyone?).<br>
