		<h1>Adrian A. Naranjo</h1>
		<h3>Software Engineer. Philosopher. Master of Unicorns.</h3>	

		<p>
				My professional career began with the brilliant decision to study philosophy as an undergrad (it really was a great decision). Unfortunately, employers didn't agree, so I studied some finance and started working at a hospital. There I built models of patient trends using Excel and SQL while learning a bit about databases and a lot about data wrangling.<br>
			<br>
			Since then I've been employed as an analytics consultant until finally hired by a boutique consulting firm to build the data and logic layers of a product which visualized a hospital's finances. By now I was a database expert deploying deploying ETL processes, running UNIX on my home machine, and scraping websites using Java and Python in my free time. Then it hit me: I'm head over heals for computing. So, why not go back to school and have a blast studying Computer Science at a steller university? That brings us to today.

		<h2>Projects (Not Listed on GitHub)</h2>
		<h3>837 Parser</h3>
			<p>
				837 files contain patient claim transaction data from a healthcare organization. Few alternatives exist to parse the complicated formating of these files. Using Python and Regular Expressions these files are parsed and a simple, easy to read output is produced. While working at a previous employer this parser saved my employer a monthly subscription to a external vendor who provides such functionality.

		<h3>Charge Capture Assessment Tool</h3>
			<p>
				Consultants often spend several days to weeks assessing clients prior to offering services or implementing solutions. This tool automateis repetitive tasks associated with a Charge Capture Assessment. The tool tested data integrity, performed descriptive statistical analysis, and modeled potential future states.
