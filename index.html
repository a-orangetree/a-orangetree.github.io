		<h1>Hi. I'm Adrian</h1>

		<p>
				Hi. I'm Adrian. Quck summary: I studied philosophy as an undergraduate, worked for a few years doing analytics
				consulting, and now study computer science at <href = "http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/">
					Northwestern University</a>. I've lived all around the US (including Miami, Dallas, Philadelphia, and Chicago),
					and love coffee shops, breweries, and traveling to the southwest US.

					Technical speaking, I'm good with data. I've been at for a while, and having worked in an industry where clients
					generally have terrible processes and data (hence, why they hire consultants), has made me adaptable and given
					me a diverse set of skills.

		<h3>837 Parser</h3>
			<p>
				837 files contain patient claim transaction data from a healthcare organization. Few alternatives exist to parse the complicated formating of these files. Using Python and Regular Expressions these files are parsed and a simple, easy to read output is produced. While working at a previous employer this parser saved my employer a monthly subscription to a external vendor who provides such functionality.
			</p>

		<h3>Charge Capture Assessment Tool</h3>
			<p>
				Consultants often spend several days to weeks assessing clients prior to offering services or implementing solutions. This tool automates repetitive tasks associated with a Charge Capture Assessment. The tool tested data integrity, performed descriptive statistical analysis, and modeled potential future states.
