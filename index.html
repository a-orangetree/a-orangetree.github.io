		<h1>Adrian Naranjo</h1>
			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I'm a software engineer who builds intelligent, automated programs. Currently I'm a graduate
					student studying computer science <a href = "http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a>.
					Before returning to school I traveled the US, Canada, and Mexico for a several years developing analytic
					tools for healthcare organizations. Prior to consulting, I earned a bachelors degree in philosophy while focusing on German phenomenology, early
					modern political philosophy, and publishing <a href =
					"http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/54596041/keeping-full-responsibility-by-choice-aristotles-nicomachean-ethics"
					>work</a> on Aristotle's ethics.</p>

		<h3>Predicting Micro-Loan Defaults on Prosper.com</h3>
			<p>Using only Amount Borrowed, Borrower Rating, Length of the Loan, and Interest Rate, was able to predict
				whether a loan would default with 74% accuracy with a gradient boosted tree. </p>

		<h3>Predicting Crime in Austin, TX</h3>
			<p>Predicted crime in Austin, TX for the year 2016 by zip code. An rmse of 375 was achieved using
				Lasso. Should historical crime data be added from the years 2014 and 2015 the rmse drops to 154.</p>

		<h3>Deducing the Origin of Facebook Confessions Board Posts Using Only Sentiment</h3>
			<p>Built a classifier to categorize the country of origin of posts on Facebook Confessions Board using only
					sentiment. Random forest and boosted trees resulted in a model accuracy of +90%.</p>

		<h3>College Football Scraper & Analysis</h3>
			<p>Used Python to retrieve college football team, player, and game statistics from the web, store data in a
					SQLite database, and perform analyses using Pythonâ€™s NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib libraries. Since
					this no longer being maintained, it is now a tutorial on the pandas library.</p>
