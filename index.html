		<h1>Hi. I'm Adrian</h1>

		<p>Hi. I'm Adrian. Quck summary: I studied philosophy as an undergrad, worked for a few years doing analytics
				consulting, and now study computer science at <href = "http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/">
				Northwestern University</a>. I've lived all around the US (including Miami, Dallas, Philadelphia, and Chicago),
				and love coffee shops, breweries, and think <href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0257106/">
				Scary Movie 2</a> is one of the funniest movies of all time  (you'll agree with me if <href =
				"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080339/">Airplane!</a> is your second favorite comedy).</p>

			</br>

		<p>Technical speaking, I'm great with data. Having worked in an industry where clients
				generally have outdated processes and terrible data (hence, why they hire consultants) has made me adaptable
				and given me a <href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZOywn1qArI">diverse set of skills</a>.	</p>
